This helps to identify the \"distance\" between a given value and the mean. In other words, how much a value *deviates* from the mean.  \n",

    "Here is how it works. \n",
    "\n",
    "R-Squared uses a so-called \"baseline\" model which is a very simple, naive model. This baseline model does not make use of any independent variables to predict the value of dependent variable Y. Instead, it uses the **mean** of the observed responses of the dependent variable $y$ and always predicts this mean as the value of $y$ for any value of $x$. In the image below, this model is given by the straight orange line.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can see that, in this plot, the baseline model always predicts the mean of $y$ **irrespective** of the value of the $x$. The red line, however, is our fitted regression line which makes use of $x$ values to predict the values of $y$. Looking at the plot above, R-Squared simply asks the question:\n",
    "\n",
    ">** Is our fitted regression line better than our baseline (worst) model ?**\n",

    "Any regression model that we fit is compared to this baseline model to understand its **goodness of fit**. Simply put, R-Squared just explains how good is your model when compared to the baseline model. That's about it. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating R-Squared ?\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical formula to calculate R-Squared for a linear regression line is in terms of **squared errors** for the fitted model and the baseline model. It's calculated as :\n",
