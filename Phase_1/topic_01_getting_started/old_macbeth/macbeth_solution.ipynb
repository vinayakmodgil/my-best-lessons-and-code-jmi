    "# Project: Analyzing Macbeth\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Now we're going to do some rudimentary analysis of Shakespeare's classic play: Macbeth! You will get practice working with lists and dictionaries, conditionals, visualizing data, and thinking analytically about data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Apply string methods to make changes to a string\n",
    "* Use a `for` loop to iterate over a collection\n",
    "* Assign values in a dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting the Data\n",
    "Here we start by importing a Python package called `requests`. We'll use it to pull the transcript of Macbeth from the [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) website. We'll also preview a few details about what is now stored in the variable `macbeth`. As you can see, it's a string with 120,253 characters - the first 500 of which are printed below. "

    "## Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a bar graph of the 25 most common words in Shakespeare's Macbeth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A common Python programming pattern to count objects, produce histograms, or update statistics is to make calls to a dictionary as you iterate through a list. For example, given a list of words, you can create a dictionary to store counts and then iterate through the list of words, checking how many times each word has appeared using your dictionary, and updating the dictionary count now that you've seen that word again. The `.get()` dictionary method is very useful in doing this. Read the docstring for the `.get()` method and use it along with the pseudocode below to create a bar graph of the 25 most common words from the transcript of Macbeth which has been loaded into the variable 'macbeth'. Be sure to include a title and appropriate labels for your graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the 25 *most common* words, you will have to sort your counts. If you are not super sure how to do this, checkout out the [Sorting HOW TO](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html) Python documentation. Part of being a data scientist is figuring out how to do tasks that you may not have done before. Remember, in these situations, Google is your friend!"

I am Thane of Cawdor.\\r\\nIf good? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion,\\r\\nWhose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire,\\r\\nAnd make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes,\\r\\nAgainst the vse of Nature?

When I burnt in desire to question them\\r\\nfurther, they made themselues Ayre, into which they vanish'd.\\r\\nWhiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came Missiues from\\r\\nthe King, who all-hail'd me Thane of Cawdor, by which Title\\r\\nbefore, these weyward Sisters saluted me, and referr'd me to\\r\\nthe comming on of time, with haile King that shalt be. This\\r\\nhaue I thought good to deliuer thee (my dearest Partner of\\r\\nGreatnesse) that thou might'st not loose the dues of reioycing\\r\\nby being ignorant of what Greatnesse is promis'd thee.

Heere,\\r\\nBut heere, vpon this Banke and Schoole of time,\\r\\nWee'ld iumpe the life to come. But in these Cases,\\r\\nWe still haue iudgement heere, that we but teach\\r\\nBloody Instructions, which being taught, returne\\r\\nTo plague th' Inuenter, this euen-handed Iustice\\r\\nCommends th' Ingredience of our poyson'd Challice\\r\\nTo our owne lips.

Was the hope drunke,\\r\\nWherein you drest your selfe? Hath it slept since?\\r\\nAnd wakes it now to looke so greene, and pale,\\r\\nAt what it did so freely? From this time,\\r\\nSuch I account thy loue. Art thou affear'd\\r\\nTo be the same in thine owne Act, and Valour,\\r\\nAs thou art in desire? Would'st thou haue that\\r\\nWhich thou esteem'st the Ornament of Life,\\r\\nAnd liue a Coward in thine owne Esteeme?\\r\\nLetting I dare not, wait vpon I would,\\r\\nLike the poore Cat i'th' Addage\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Prythee peace:\\r\\nI dare do all that may become a man,\\r\\nWho dares do more, is none\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. What Beast was't then\\r\\nThat made you breake this enterprize to me?\\r\\nWhen you durst do it, then you were a man:\\r\\nAnd to be more then what you were, you would\\r\\nBe so much more the man. Nor time, nor place\\r\\nDid then adhere, and yet you would make both:\\r\\nThey haue made themselues, and that their fitnesse now\\r\\nDo's vnmake you. I haue giuen Sucke, and know\\r\\nHow tender 'tis to loue the Babe that milkes me,\\r\\nI would, while it was smyling in my Face,\\r\\nHaue pluckt my Nipple from his Bonelesse Gummes,\\r\\nAnd dasht the Braines out, had I so sworne\\r\\nAs you haue done to this\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb.

Being vnprepar'd,\\r\\nOur will became the seruant to defect,\\r\\nWhich else should free haue wrought\\r\\n\\r\\n   Banq. All's well.\\r\\nI dreamt last Night of the three weyward Sisters:\\r\\nTo you they haue shew'd some truth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. I thinke not of them:\\r\\nYet when we can entreat an houre to serue,\\r\\nWe would spend it in some words vpon that Businesse,\\r\\nIf you would graunt the time\\r\\n\\r\\n   Banq.

Get thee to bed.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs this a Dagger, which I see before me,\\r\\nThe Handle toward my Hand? Come, let me clutch thee:\\r\\nI haue thee not, and yet I see thee still.\\r\\nArt thou not fatall Vision, sensible\\r\\nTo feeling, as to sight? or art thou but\\r\\nA Dagger of the Minde, a false Creation,\\r\\nProceeding from the heat-oppressed Braine?\\r\\nI see thee yet, in forme as palpable,\\r\\nAs this which now I draw.\\r\\nThou marshall'st me the way that I was going,\\r\\nAnd such an Instrument I was to vse.\\r\\nMine Eyes are made the fooles o'th' other Sences,\\r\\nOr else worth all the rest: I see thee still;\\r\\nAnd on thy Blade, and Dudgeon, Gouts of Blood,\\r\\nWhich was not so before. There's no such thing:\\r\\nIt is the bloody Businesse, which informes\\r\\nThus to mine Eyes. Now o're the one halfe World\\r\\nNature seemes dead, and wicked Dreames abuse\\r\\nThe Curtain'd sleepe: Witchcraft celebrates\\r\\nPale Heccats Offrings: and wither'd Murther,\\r\\nAlarum'd by his Centinell, the Wolfe,\\r\\nWhose howle's his Watch, thus with his stealthy pace,\\r\\nWith Tarquins rauishing sides, towards his designe\\r\\nMoues like a Ghost. Thou sowre and firme-set Earth\\r\\nHeare not my steps, which they may walke, for feare\\r\\nThy very stones prate of my where-about,\\r\\nAnd take the present horror from the time,\\r\\nWhich now sutes with it. Whiles I threat, he liues:\\r\\nWords to the heat of deedes too cold breath giues.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Bell rings.\\r\\n\\r\\nI goe, and it is done: the Bell inuites me.\\r\\nHeare it not, Duncan, for it is a Knell,\\r\\nThat summons thee to Heauen, or to Hell.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScena Secunda.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n  La.

I haue drugg'd their Possets,\\r\\nThat Death and Nature doe contend about them,\\r\\nWhether they liue, or dye.\\r\\nEnter Macbeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. Who's there? what hoa?\\r\\n  Lady. Alack, I am afraid they haue awak'd,\\r\\nAnd 'tis not done: th' attempt, and not the deed,\\r\\nConfounds vs: hearke: I lay'd their Daggers ready,\\r\\nHe could not misse 'em. Had he not resembled\\r\\nMy Father as he slept, I had don't.\\r\\nMy Husband?\\r\\n  Macb. I haue done the deed:\\r\\nDidst thou not heare a noyse?\\r\\n  Lady.

Hearke, who lyes i'th' second Chamber?\\r\\n  Lady. Donalbaine\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mac. This is a sorry sight\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. There's one did laugh in's sleepe,\\r\\nAnd one cry'd Murther, that they did wake each other:\\r\\nI stood, and heard them: But they did say their Prayers,\\r\\nAnd addrest them againe to sleepe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. There are two lodg'd together\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. One cry'd God blesse vs, and Amen the other,\\r\\nAs they had seene me with these Hangmans hands:\\r\\nListning their feare, I could not say Amen,\\r\\nWhen they did say God blesse vs\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. Consider it not so deepely\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mac. But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen?\\r\\nI had most need of Blessing, and Amen stuck in my throat\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. These deeds must not be thought\\r\\nAfter these wayes: so, it will make vs mad\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Me thought I heard a voyce cry, Sleep no more:\\r\\nMacbeth does murther Sleepe, the innocent Sleepe,\\r\\nSleepe that knits vp the rauel'd Sleeue of Care,\\r\\nThe death of each dayes Life, sore Labors Bath,\\r\\nBalme of hurt Mindes, great Natures second Course,\\r\\nChiefe nourisher in Life's Feast\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady.

Still it cry'd, Sleepe no more to all the House:\\r\\nGlamis hath murther'd Sleepe, and therefore Cawdor\\r\\nShall sleepe no more: Macbeth shall sleepe no more\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. Who was it, that thus cry'd? why worthy Thane,\\r\\nYou doe vnbend your Noble strength, to thinke\\r\\nSo braine-sickly of things: Goe get some Water,\\r\\nAnd wash this filthie Witnesse from your Hand.\\r\\nWhy did you bring these Daggers from the place?\\r\\nThey must lye there: goe carry them, and smeare\\r\\nThe sleepie Groomes with blood\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Ile goe no more:\\r\\nI am afraid, to thinke what I haue done:\\r\\nLooke on't againe, I dare not\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. Infirme of purpose:\\r\\nGiue me the Daggers: the sleeping, and the dead,\\r\\nAre but as Pictures: 'tis the Eye of Childhood,\\r\\nThat feares a painted Deuill. If he doe bleed,\\r\\nIle guild the Faces of the Groomes withall,\\r\\nFor it must seeme their Guilt.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnocke within.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb.

Who's there\\r\\ni'th' name of Belzebub? Here's a Farmer, that hang'd\\r\\nhimselfe on th' expectation of Plentie: Come in time, haue\\r\\nNapkins enow about you, here you'le sweat for't.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnock.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnock, knock. Who's there in th' other Deuils Name?\\r\\nFaith here's an Equiuocator, that could sweare in both\\r\\nthe Scales against eyther Scale, who committed Treason\\r\\nenough for Gods sake, yet could not equiuocate to Heauen:\\r\\noh come in, Equiuocator.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnock.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnock, Knock, Knock.

Marry, Sir, Nose-painting, Sleepe, and Vrine.\\r\\nLecherie, Sir, it prouokes, and vnprouokes: it prouokes\\r\\nthe desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore\\r\\nmuch Drinke may be said to be an Equiuocator with Lecherie:\\r\\nit makes him, and it marres him; it sets him on,\\r\\nand it takes him off; it perswades him, and dis-heartens\\r\\nhim; makes him stand too, and not stand too: in conclusion,\\r\\nequiuocates him in a sleepe, and giuing him the Lye,\\r\\nleaues him\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I beleeue, Drinke gaue thee the Lye last Night\\r\\n\\r\\n   Port.

Goes the King hence to day?\\r\\n  Macb. He does: he did appoint so\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lenox. The Night ha's been vnruly:\\r\\nWhere we lay, our Chimneys were blowne downe,\\r\\nAnd (as they say) lamentings heard i'th' Ayre;\\r\\nStrange Schreemes of Death,\\r\\nAnd Prophecying, with Accents terrible,\\r\\nOf dyre Combustion, and confus'd Euents,\\r\\nNew hatch'd toth' wofull time.\\r\\nThe obscure Bird clamor'd the liue-long Night.\\r\\nSome say, the Earth was Feuorous,\\r\\nAnd did shake\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb.

O horror, horror, horror,\\r\\nTongue nor Heart cannot conceiue, nor name thee\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. and Lenox. What's the matter?\\r\\n  Macd. Confusion now hath made his Master-peece:\\r\\nMost sacrilegious Murther hath broke ope\\r\\nThe Lords anoynted Temple, and stole thence\\r\\nThe Life o'th' Building\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. What is't you say, the Life?\\r\\n  Lenox. Meane you his Maiestie?\\r\\n  Macd. Approch the Chamber, and destroy your sight\\r\\nWith a new Gorgon. Doe not bid me speake:\\r\\nSee, and then speake your selues: awake, awake,\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt. Macbeth and Lenox.\\r\\n\\r\\nRing the Alarum Bell: Murther, and Treason,\\r\\nBanquo, and Donalbaine: Malcolme awake,\\r\\nShake off this Downey sleepe, Deaths counterfeit,\\r\\nAnd looke on Death it selfe: vp, vp, and see\\r\\nThe great Doomes Image: Malcolme, Banquo,\\r\\nAs from your Graues rise vp, and walke like Sprights,\\r\\nTo countenance this horror. Ring the Bell.\\r\\n\\r\\nBell rings. Enter Lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lady. What's the Businesse?\\r\\nThat such a hideous Trumpet calls to parley\\r\\nThe sleepers of the House? speake, speake\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd.

Woe, alas:\\r\\nWhat, in our House?\\r\\n  Ban. Too cruell, any where.\\r\\nDeare Duff, I prythee contradict thy selfe,\\r\\nAnd say, it is not so.\\r\\nEnter Macbeth, Lenox, and Rosse.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. Had I but dy'd an houre before this chance,\\r\\nI had liu'd a blessed time: for from this instant,\\r\\nThere's nothing serious in Mortalitie:\\r\\nAll is but Toyes: Renowne and Grace is dead,\\r\\nThe Wine of Life is drawne, and the meere Lees\\r\\nIs left this Vault, to brag of.\\r\\nEnter Malcolme and Donalbaine.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Donal. What is amisse?\\r\\n  Macb. You are, and doe not know't:\\r\\nThe Spring, the Head, the Fountaine of your Blood\\r\\nIs stopt, the very Source of it is stopt\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Your Royall Father's murther'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Oh, by whom?\\r\\n  Lenox. Those of his Chamber, as it seem'd, had don't:\\r\\nTheir Hands and Faces were all badg'd with blood,\\r\\nSo were their Daggers, which vnwip'd, we found\\r\\nVpon their Pillowes: they star'd, and were distracted,\\r\\nNo mans Life was to be trusted with them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. O, yet I doe repent me of my furie,\\r\\nThat I did kill them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Wherefore did you so?\\r\\n  Macb. Who can be wise, amaz'd, temp'rate, & furious,\\r\\nLoyall, and Neutrall, in a moment? No man:\\r\\nTh' expedition of my violent Loue\\r\\nOut-run the pawser, Reason. Here lay Duncan,\\r\\nHis Siluer skinne, lac'd with His Golden Blood,\\r\\nAnd his gash'd Stabs, look'd like a Breach in Nature,\\r\\nFor Ruines wastfull entrance: there the Murtherers,\\r\\nSteep'd in the Colours of their Trade; their Daggers\\r\\nVnmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refraine,\\r\\nThat had a heart to loue; and in that heart,\\r\\nCourage, to make's loue knowne?\\r\\n  Lady. Helpe me hence, hoa\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Looke to the Lady\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Why doe we hold our tongues,\\r\\nThat most may clayme this argument for ours?\\r\\n  Donal.

Nor our strong Sorrow\\r\\nVpon the foot of Motion\\r\\n\\r\\n   Banq. Looke to the Lady:\\r\\nAnd when we haue our naked Frailties hid,\\r\\nThat suffer in exposure; let vs meet,\\r\\nAnd question this most bloody piece of worke,\\r\\nTo know it further. Feares and scruples shake vs:\\r\\nIn the great Hand of God I stand, and thence,\\r\\nAgainst the vndivulg'd pretence, I fight\\r\\nOf Treasonous Mallice\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. And so doe I\\r\\n\\r\\n   All. So all\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Let's briefely put on manly readinesse,\\r\\nAnd meet i'th' Hall together\\r\\n\\r\\n   All.

Threescore and ten I can remember well,\\r\\nWithin the Volume of which Time, I haue seene\\r\\nHoures dreadfull, and things strange: but this sore Night\\r\\nHath trifled former knowings\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Ha, good Father,\\r\\nThou seest the Heauens, as troubled with mans Act,\\r\\nThreatens his bloody Stage: byth' Clock 'tis Day,\\r\\nAnd yet darke Night strangles the trauailing Lampe:\\r\\nIs't Nights predominance, or the Dayes shame,\\r\\nThat Darknesse does the face of Earth intombe,\\r\\nWhen liuing Light should kisse it?\\r\\n  Old man. 'Tis vnnaturall,\\r\\nEuen like the deed that's done: On Tuesday last,\\r\\nA Faulcon towring in her pride of place,\\r\\nWas by a Mowsing Owle hawkt at, and kill'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. And Duncans Horses,\\r\\n(A thing most strange, and certaine)\\r\\nBeauteous, and swift, the Minions of their Race,\\r\\nTurn'd wilde in nature, broke their stalls, flong out,\\r\\nContending 'gainst Obedience, as they would\\r\\nMake Warre with Mankinde\\r\\n\\r\\n   Old man. 'Tis said, they eate each other\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse.

Why see you not?\\r\\n  Ross. Is't known who did this more then bloody deed?\\r\\n  Macd. Those that Macbeth hath slaine\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ross. Alas the day,\\r\\nWhat good could they pretend?\\r\\n  Macd. They were subborned,\\r\\nMalcolme, and Donalbaine the Kings two Sonnes\\r\\nAre stolne away and fled, which puts vpon them\\r\\nSuspition of the deed\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. 'Gainst Nature still,\\r\\nThriftlesse Ambition, that will rauen vp\\r\\nThine owne liues meanes: Then 'tis most like,\\r\\nThe Soueraignty will fall vpon Macbeth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd.

If there come truth from them,\\r\\nAs vpon thee Macbeth, their Speeches shine,\\r\\nWhy by the verities on thee made good,\\r\\nMay they not be my Oracles as well,\\r\\nAnd set me vp in hope. But hush, no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nSenit sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Lenox, Rosse, Lords,\\r\\nand\\r\\nAttendants.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. Heere's our chiefe Guest\\r\\n\\r\\n   La.

'Tis much he dares,\\r\\nAnd to that dauntlesse temper of his Minde,\\r\\nHe hath a Wisdome, that doth guide his Valour,\\r\\nTo act in safetie. There is none but he,\\r\\nWhose being I doe feare: and vnder him,\\r\\nMy Genius is rebuk'd, as it is said\\r\\nMark Anthonies was by Caesar. He chid the Sisters,\\r\\nWhen first they put the Name of King vpon me,\\r\\nAnd bad them speake to him. Then Prophet-like,\\r\\nThey hayl'd him Father to a Line of Kings.\\r\\nVpon my Head they plac'd a fruitlesse Crowne,\\r\\nAnd put a barren Scepter in my Gripe,\\r\\nThence to be wrencht with an vnlineall Hand,\\r\\nNo Sonne of mine succeeding: if't be so,\\r\\nFor Banquo's Issue haue I fil'd my Minde,\\r\\nFor them, the gracious Duncan haue I murther'd,\\r\\nPut Rancours in the Vessell of my Peace\\r\\nOnely for them, and mine eternall Iewell\\r\\nGiuen to the common Enemie of Man,\\r\\nTo make them Kings, the Seedes of Banquo Kings.\\r\\nRather then so, come Fate into the Lyst,\\r\\nAnd champion me to th' vtterance.\\r\\nWho's there?\\r\\nEnter Seruant, and two Murtherers.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow goe to the Doore, and stay there till we call.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit Seruant.\\r\\n\\r\\nWas it not yesterday we spoke together?\\r\\n  Murth.

He needes not our mistrust, since he deliuers\\r\\nOur Offices, and what we haue to doe,\\r\\nTo the direction iust\\r\\n\\r\\n   1.

Thou art the best o'th' Cut-throats,\\r\\nYet hee's good that did the like for Fleans:\\r\\nIf thou did'st it, thou art the Non-pareill\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mur. Most Royall Sir\\r\\nFleans is scap'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Then comes my Fit againe:\\r\\nI had else beene perfect;\\r\\nWhole as the Marble, founded as the Rocke,\\r\\nAs broad, and generall, as the casing Ayre:\\r\\nBut now I am cabin'd, crib'd, confin'd, bound in\\r\\nTo sawcy doubts, and feares. But Banquo's safe?\\r\\n  Mur. I, my good Lord: safe in a ditch he bides,\\r\\nWith twenty trenched gashes on his head;\\r\\nThe least a Death to Nature\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Thankes for that:\\r\\nThere the growne Serpent lyes, the worme that's fled\\r\\nHath Nature that in time will Venom breed,\\r\\nNo teeth for th' present.

Sweet Remembrancer:\\r\\nNow good digestion waite on Appetite,\\r\\nAnd health on both\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lenox. May't please your Highnesse sit\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Here had we now our Countries Honor, roof'd,\\r\\nWere the grac'd person of our Banquo present:\\r\\nWho, may I rather challenge for vnkindnesse,\\r\\nThen pitty for Mischance\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. His absence (Sir)\\r\\nLayes blame vpon his promise. Pleas't your Highnesse\\r\\nTo grace vs with your Royall Company?\\r\\n  Macb. The Table's full\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lenox. Heere is a place reseru'd Sir\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Where?\\r\\n  Lenox. Heere my good Lord.\\r\\nWhat is't that moues your Highnesse?\\r\\n  Macb. Which of you haue done this?\\r\\n  Lords. What, my good Lord?\\r\\n  Macb. Thou canst not say I did it: neuer shake\\r\\nThy goary lockes at me\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Gentlemen rise, his Highnesse is not well\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. Sit worthy Friends: my Lord is often thus,\\r\\nAnd hath beene from his youth. Pray you keepe Seat,\\r\\nThe fit is momentary, vpon a thought\\r\\nHe will againe be well. If much you note him\\r\\nYou shall offend him, and extend his Passion,\\r\\nFeed, and regard him not. Are you a man?\\r\\n  Macb. I, and a bold one, that dare looke on that\\r\\nWhich might appall the Diuell\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. O proper stuffe:\\r\\nThis is the very painting of your feare:\\r\\nThis is the Ayre-drawne-Dagger which you said\\r\\nLed you to Duncan. O, these flawes and starts\\r\\n(Impostors to true feare) would well become\\r\\nA womans story, at a Winters fire\\r\\nAuthoriz'd by her Grandam: shame it selfe,\\r\\nWhy do you make such faces? When all's done\\r\\nYou looke but on a stoole\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Prythee see there:\\r\\nBehold, looke, loe, how say you:\\r\\nWhy what care I, if thou canst nod, speake too.\\r\\nIf Charnell houses, and our Graues must send\\r\\nThose that we bury, backe; our Monuments\\r\\nShall be the Mawes of Kytes\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. What? quite vnmann'd in folly\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. If I stand heere, I saw him\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. Fie for shame\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Blood hath bene shed ere now, i'th' olden time\\r\\nEre humane Statute purg'd the gentle Weale:\\r\\nI, and since too, Murthers haue bene perform'd\\r\\nToo terrible for the eare. The times has bene,\\r\\nThat when the Braines were out, the man would dye,\\r\\nAnd there an end: But now they rise againe\\r\\nWith twenty mortall murthers on their crownes,\\r\\nAnd push vs from our stooles. This is more strange\\r\\nThen such a murther is\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. My worthy Lord\\r\\nYour Noble Friends do lacke you\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. I do forget:\\r\\nDo not muse at me my most worthy Friends,\\r\\nI haue a strange infirmity, which is nothing\\r\\nTo those that know me. Come, loue and health to all,\\r\\nThen Ile sit downe: Giue me some Wine, fill full:\\r\\nEnter Ghost.\\r\\n\\r\\nI drinke to th' generall ioy o'th' whole Table,\\r\\nAnd to our deere Friend Banquo, whom we misse:\\r\\nWould he were heere: to all, and him we thirst,\\r\\nAnd all to all\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lords.

Auant, & quit my sight, let the earth hide thee:\\r\\nThy bones are marrowlesse, thy blood is cold:\\r\\nThou hast no speculation in those eyes\\r\\nWhich thou dost glare with\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. Thinke of this good Peeres\\r\\nBut as a thing of Custome: 'Tis no other,\\r\\nOnely it spoyles the pleasure of the time\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. What man dare, I dare:\\r\\nApproach thou like the rugged Russian Beare,\\r\\nThe arm'd Rhinoceros, or th' Hircan Tiger,\\r\\nTake any shape but that, and my firme Nerues\\r\\nShall neuer tremble. Or be aliue againe,\\r\\nAnd dare me to the Desart with thy Sword:\\r\\nIf trembling I inhabit then, protest mee\\r\\nThe Baby of a Girle. Hence horrible shadow,\\r\\nVnreall mock'ry hence. Why so, being gone\\r\\nI am a man againe: pray you sit still\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. You haue displac'd the mirth,\\r\\nBroke the good meeting, with most admir'd disorder\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Can such things be,\\r\\nAnd ouercome vs like a Summers Clowd,\\r\\nWithout our speciall wonder? You make me strange\\r\\nEuen to the disposition that I owe,\\r\\nWhen now I thinke you can behold such sights,\\r\\nAnd keepe the naturall Rubie of your Cheekes,\\r\\nWhen mine is blanch'd with feare\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. What sights, my Lord?\\r\\n  La. I pray you speake not: he growes worse & worse\\r\\nQuestion enrages him: at once, goodnight.\\r\\nStand not vpon the order of your going,\\r\\nBut go at once\\r\\n\\r\\n   Len. Good night, and better health\\r\\nAttend his Maiesty\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. A kinde goodnight to all.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit Lords.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. It will haue blood they say:\\r\\nBlood will haue Blood:\\r\\nStones haue beene knowne to moue, & Trees to speake:\\r\\nAugures, and vnderstood Relations, haue\\r\\nBy Maggot Pyes, & Choughes, & Rookes brought forth\\r\\nThe secret'st man of Blood. What is the night?\\r\\n  La. Almost at oddes with morning, which is which\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. How say'st thou that Macduff denies his person\\r\\nAt our great bidding\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. Did you send to him Sir?\\r\\n  Macb. I heare it by the way: But I will send:\\r\\nThere's not a one of them but in his house\\r\\nI keepe a Seruant Feed. I will to morrow\\r\\n(And betimes I will) to the weyard Sisters.\\r\\nMore shall they speake: for now I am bent to know\\r\\nBy the worst meanes, the worst, for mine owne good,\\r\\nAll causes shall giue way. I am in blood\\r\\nStept in so farre, that should I wade no more,\\r\\nReturning were as tedious as go ore:\\r\\nStrange things I haue in head, that will to hand,\\r\\nWhich must be acted, ere they may be scand\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. You lacke the season of all Natures, sleepe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Come, wee'l to sleepe: My strange & self-abuse\\r\\nIs the initiate feare, that wants hard vse:\\r\\nWe are yet but yong indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScena Quinta.\\r\\n\\r\\nThunder. Enter the three Witches, meeting Hecat.\\r\\n\\r\\n  1. Why how now Hecat, you looke angerly?\\r\\n  Hec. Haue I not reason (Beldams) as you are?\\r\\nSawcy, and ouer-bold, how did you dare\\r\\nTo Trade, and Trafficke with Macbeth,\\r\\nIn Riddles, and Affaires of death;\\r\\nAnd I the Mistris of your Charmes,\\r\\nThe close contriuer of all harmes,\\r\\nWas neuer call'd to beare my part,\\r\\nOr shew the glory of our Art?\\r\\nAnd which is worse, all you haue done\\r\\nHath bene but for a wayward Sonne,\\r\\nSpightfull, and wrathfull, who (as others do)\\r\\nLoues for his owne ends, not for you.\\r\\nBut make amends now: Get you gon,\\r\\nAnd at the pit of Acheron\\r\\nMeete me i'th' Morning: thither he\\r\\nWill come, to know his Destinie.\\r\\nYour Vessels, and your Spels prouide,\\r\\nYour Charmes, and euery thing beside;\\r\\nI am for th' Ayre: This night Ile spend\\r\\nVnto a dismall, and a Fatall end.\\r\\nGreat businesse must be wrought ere Noone.\\r\\nVpon the Corner of the Moone\\r\\nThere hangs a vap'rous drop, profound,\\r\\nIle catch it ere it come to ground;\\r\\nAnd that distill'd by Magicke slights,\\r\\nShall raise such Artificiall Sprights,\\r\\nAs by the strength of their illusion,\\r\\nShall draw him on to his Confusion.\\r\\nHe shall spurne Fate, scorne Death, and beare\\r\\nHis hopes 'boue Wisedome, Grace, and Feare:\\r\\nAnd you all know, Security\\r\\nIs Mortals cheefest Enemie.\\r\\n\\r\\nMusicke, and a Song.\\r\\n\\r\\nHearke, I am call'd: my little Spirit see\\r\\nSits in Foggy cloud, and stayes for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nSing within.

My former Speeches,\\r\\nHaue but hit your Thoughts\\r\\nWhich can interpret farther: Onely I say\\r\\nThings haue bin strangely borne. The gracious Duncan\\r\\nWas pittied of Macbeth: marry he was dead:\\r\\nAnd the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late,\\r\\nWhom you may say (if't please you) Fleans kill'd,\\r\\nFor Fleans fled: Men must not walke too late.\\r\\nWho cannot want the thought, how monstrous\\r\\nIt was for Malcolme, and for Donalbane\\r\\nTo kill their gracious Father? Damned Fact,\\r\\nHow it did greeue Macbeth? Did he not straight\\r\\nIn pious rage, the two delinquents teare,\\r\\nThat were the Slaues of drinke, and thralles of sleepe?\\r\\nWas not that Nobly done? I, and wisely too:\\r\\nFor 'twould haue anger'd any heart aliue\\r\\nTo heare the men deny't. So that I say,\\r\\nHe ha's borne all things well, and I do thinke,\\r\\nThat had he Duncans Sonnes vnder his Key,\\r\\n(As, and't please Heauen he shall not) they should finde\\r\\nWhat 'twere to kill a Father: So should Fleans.\\r\\nBut peace; for from broad words, and cause he fayl'd\\r\\nHis presence at the Tyrants Feast, I heare\\r\\nMacduffe liues in disgrace. Sir, can you tell\\r\\nWhere he bestowes himselfe?\\r\\n  Lord. The Sonnes of Duncane\\r\\n(From whom this Tyrant holds the due of Birth)\\r\\nLiues in the English Court, and is receyu'd\\r\\nOf the most Pious Edward, with such grace,\\r\\nThat the maleuolence of Fortune, nothing\\r\\nTakes from his high respect. Thither Macduffe\\r\\nIs gone, to pray the Holy King, vpon his ayd\\r\\nTo wake Northumberland, and warlike Seyward,\\r\\nThat by the helpe of these (with him aboue)\\r\\nTo ratifie the Worke) we may againe\\r\\nGiue to our Tables meate, sleepe to our Nights:\\r\\nFree from our Feasts, and Banquets bloody kniues;\\r\\nDo faithfull Homage, and receiue free Honors,\\r\\nAll which we pine for now. And this report\\r\\nHath so exasperate their King, that hee\\r\\nPrepares for some attempt of Warre\\r\\n\\r\\n   Len. Sent he to Macduffe?\\r\\n  Lord. He did: and with an absolute Sir, not I\\r\\nThe clowdy Messenger turnes me his backe,\\r\\nAnd hums; as who should say, you'l rue the time\\r\\nThat clogges me with this Answer\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lenox. And that well might\\r\\nAduise him to a Caution, t' hold what distance\\r\\nHis wisedome can prouide. Some holy Angell\\r\\nFlye to the Court of England, and vnfold\\r\\nHis Message ere he come, that a swift blessing\\r\\nMay soone returne to this our suffering Country,\\r\\nVnder a hand accurs'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lord.

I will be satisfied.

And euen now\\r\\nTo Crown my thoughts with Acts: be it thoght & done:\\r\\nThe Castle of Macduff, I will surprize.\\r\\nSeize vpon Fife; giue to th' edge o'th' Sword\\r\\nHis Wife, his Babes, and all vnfortunate Soules\\r\\nThat trace him in his Line. No boasting like a Foole,\\r\\nThis deed Ile do, before this purpose coole,\\r\\nBut no more sights. Where are these Gentlemen?\\r\\nCome bring me where they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nScena Secunda.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Macduffes Wife, her Son, and Rosse.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. What had he done, to make him fly the Land?\\r\\n  Rosse. You must haue patience Madam\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. He had none:\\r\\nHis flight was madnesse: when our Actions do not,\\r\\nOur feares do make vs Traitors\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. You know not\\r\\nWhether it was his wisedome, or his feare\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Wisedom? to leaue his wife, to leaue his Babes,\\r\\nHis Mansion, and his Titles, in a place\\r\\nFrom whence himselfe do's flye? He loues vs not,\\r\\nHe wants the naturall touch. For the poore Wren\\r\\n(The most diminitiue of Birds) will fight,\\r\\nHer yong ones in her Nest, against the Owle:\\r\\nAll is the Feare, and nothing is the Loue;\\r\\nAs little is the Wisedome, where the flight\\r\\nSo runnes against all reason\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. My deerest Cooz,\\r\\nI pray you schoole your selfe. But for your Husband,\\r\\nHe is Noble, Wise, Iudicious, and best knowes\\r\\nThe fits o'th' Season. I dare not speake much further,\\r\\nBut cruell are the times, when we are Traitors\\r\\nAnd do not know our selues: when we hold Rumor\\r\\nFrom what we feare, yet know not what we feare,\\r\\nBut floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea\\r\\nEach way, and moue. I take my leaue of you:\\r\\nShall not be long but Ile be heere againe:\\r\\nThings at the worst will cease, or else climbe vpward,\\r\\nTo what they were before. My pretty Cosine,\\r\\nBlessing vpon you\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Father'd he is,\\r\\nAnd yet hee's Father-lesse\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. I am so much a Foole, should I stay longer\\r\\nIt would be my disgrace, and your discomfort.\\r\\nI take my leaue at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit Rosse.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. Sirra, your Fathers dead,\\r\\nAnd what will you do now? How will you liue?\\r\\n  Son. As Birds do Mother\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. What with Wormes, and Flyes?\\r\\n  Son. With what I get I meane, and so do they\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Poore Bird,\\r\\nThou'dst neuer Feare the Net, nor Lime,\\r\\nThe Pitfall, nor the Gin\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Why should I Mother?\\r\\nPoore Birds they are not set for:\\r\\nMy Father is not dead for all your saying\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Yes, he is dead:\\r\\nHow wilt thou do for a Father?\\r\\n  Son. Nay how will you do for a Husband?\\r\\n  Wife. Why I can buy me twenty at any Market\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Then you'l by 'em to sell againe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Thou speak'st withall thy wit,\\r\\nAnd yet I'faith with wit enough for thee\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Was my Father a Traitor, Mother?\\r\\n  Wife. I, that he was\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. What is a Traitor?\\r\\n  Wife. Why one that sweares, and lyes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. And be all Traitors, that do so\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Euery one that do's so, is a Traitor,\\r\\nAnd must be hang'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. And must they all be hang'd, that swear and lye?\\r\\n  Wife. Euery one\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Who must hang them?\\r\\n  Wife. Why, the honest men\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools: for there\\r\\nare Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate the honest men,\\r\\nand hang vp them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Now God helpe thee, poore Monkie:\\r\\nBut how wilt thou do for a Father?\\r\\n  Son. If he were dead, youl'd weepe for him: if you\\r\\nwould not, it were a good signe, that I should quickely\\r\\nhaue a new Father\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Poore pratler, how thou talk'st?\\r\\nEnter a Messenger.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mes. Blesse you faire Dame: I am not to you known,\\r\\nThough in your state of Honor I am perfect;\\r\\nI doubt some danger do's approach you neerely.\\r\\nIf you will take a homely mans aduice,\\r\\nBe not found heere: Hence with your little ones\\r\\nTo fright you thus. Me thinkes I am too sauage:\\r\\nTo do worse to you, were fell Cruelty,\\r\\nWhich is too nie your person. Heauen preserue you,\\r\\nI dare abide no longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit Messenger\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. Whether should I flye?\\r\\nI haue done no harme. But I remember now\\r\\nI am in this earthly world: where to do harme\\r\\nIs often laudable, to do good sometime\\r\\nAccounted dangerous folly. Why then (alas)\\r\\nDo I put vp that womanly defence,\\r\\nTo say I haue done no harme?\\r\\nWhat are these faces?\\r\\nEnter Murtherers.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mur. Where is your Husband?\\r\\n  Wife. I hope in no place so vnsanctified,\\r\\nWhere such as thou may'st finde him\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mur. He's a Traitor\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Thou ly'st thou shagge-ear'd Villaine\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mur. What you Egge?\\r\\nYong fry of Treachery?\\r\\n  Son. He ha's kill'd me Mother,\\r\\nRun away I pray you.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit crying Murther.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScaena Tertia.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Malcolme and Macduffe.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mal. Let vs seeke out some desolate shade, & there\\r\\nWeepe our sad bosomes empty\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Let vs rather\\r\\nHold fast the mortall Sword: and like good men,\\r\\nBestride our downfall Birthdome: each new Morne,\\r\\nNew Widdowes howle, new Orphans cry, new sorowes\\r\\nStrike heauen on the face, that it resounds\\r\\nAs if it felt with Scotland, and yell'd out\\r\\nLike Syllable of Dolour\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. What I beleeue, Ile waile;\\r\\nWhat know, beleeue; and what I can redresse,\\r\\nAs I shall finde the time to friend: I wil.\\r\\nWhat you haue spoke, it may be so perchance.\\r\\nThis Tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,\\r\\nWas once thought honest: you haue lou'd him well,\\r\\nHe hath not touch'd you yet. I am yong, but something\\r\\nYou may discerne of him through me, and wisedome\\r\\nTo offer vp a weake, poore innocent Lambe\\r\\nT' appease an angry God\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I am not treacherous\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. But Macbeth is.\\r\\nA good and vertuous Nature may recoyle\\r\\nIn an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:\\r\\nThat which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;\\r\\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest fell.\\r\\nThough all things foule, would wear the brows of grace\\r\\nYet Grace must still looke so\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I haue lost my Hopes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Perchance euen there\\r\\nWhere I did finde my doubts.\\r\\nWhy in that rawnesse left you Wife, and Childe?\\r\\nThose precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,\\r\\nWithout leaue-taking. I pray you,\\r\\nLet not my Iealousies, be your Dishonors,\\r\\nBut mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,\\r\\nWhat euer I shall thinke\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,\\r\\nGreat Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,\\r\\nFor goodnesse dare not check thee: wear y thy wrongs,\\r\\nThe Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,\\r\\nI would not be the Villaine that thou think'st,\\r\\nFor the whole Space that's in the Tyrants Graspe,\\r\\nAnd the rich East to boot\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Be not offended:\\r\\nI speake not as in absolute feare of you:\\r\\nI thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,\\r\\nIt weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash\\r\\nIs added to her wounds. I thinke withall,\\r\\nThere would be hands vplifted in my right:\\r\\nAnd heere from gracious England haue I offer\\r\\nOf goodly thousands. But for all this,\\r\\nWhen I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,\\r\\nOr weare it on my Sword; yet my poore Country\\r\\nShall haue more vices then it had before,\\r\\nMore suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,\\r\\nBy him that shall succeede\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. What should he be?\\r\\n  Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know\\r\\nAll the particulars of Vice so grafted,\\r\\nThat when they shall be open'd, blacke Macbeth\\r\\nWill seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State\\r\\nEsteeme him as a Lambe, being compar'd\\r\\nWith my confinelesse harmes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Not in the Legions\\r\\nOf horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'd\\r\\nIn euils, to top Macbeth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. I grant him Bloody,\\r\\nLuxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,\\r\\nSodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne\\r\\nThat ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none\\r\\nIn my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,\\r\\nYour Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp\\r\\nThe Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire\\r\\nAll continent Impediments would ore-beare\\r\\nThat did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,\\r\\nThen such an one to reigne\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Boundlesse intemperance\\r\\nIn Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene\\r\\nTh' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,\\r\\nAnd fall of many Kings. But feare not yet\\r\\nTo take vpon you what is yours: you may\\r\\nConuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,\\r\\nAnd yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:\\r\\nWe haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be\\r\\nThat Vulture in you, to deuoure so many\\r\\nAs will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,\\r\\nFinding it so inclinde\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. With this, there growes\\r\\nIn my most ill-composd Affection, such\\r\\nA stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,\\r\\nI should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,\\r\\nDesire his Iewels, and this others House,\\r\\nAnd my more-hauing, would be as a Sawce\\r\\nTo make me hunger more, that I should forge\\r\\nQuarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,\\r\\nDestroying them for wealth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. This Auarice\\r\\nstickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote\\r\\nThen Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath bin\\r\\nThe Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,\\r\\nScotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your will\\r\\nOf your meere Owne. All these are portable,\\r\\nWith other Graces weigh'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,\\r\\nAs Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,\\r\\nBounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,\\r\\nDeuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,\\r\\nI haue no rellish of them, but abound\\r\\nIn the diuision of each seuerall Crime,\\r\\nActing it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I should\\r\\nPoure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,\\r\\nVprore the vniuersall peace, confound\\r\\nAll vnity on earth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. O Scotland, Scotland\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:\\r\\nI am as I haue spoken\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!\\r\\nWith an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,\\r\\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?\\r\\nSince that the truest Issue of thy Throne\\r\\nBy his owne Interdiction stands accust,\\r\\nAnd do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father\\r\\nWas a most Sainted-King: the Queene that bore thee,\\r\\nOftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,\\r\\nDy'de euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,\\r\\nThese Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,\\r\\nHath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,\\r\\nThy hope ends heere\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Macduff, this Noble passion\\r\\nChilde of integrity, hath from my soule\\r\\nWip'd the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts\\r\\nTo thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish Macbeth,\\r\\nBy many of these traines, hath sought to win me\\r\\nInto his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me\\r\\nFrom ouer-credulous hast: but God aboue\\r\\nDeale betweene thee and me; For euen now\\r\\nI put my selfe to thy Direction, and\\r\\nVnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure\\r\\nThe taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,\\r\\nFor strangers to my Nature. I am yet\\r\\nVnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,\\r\\nScarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.\\r\\nAt no time broke my Faith, would not betray\\r\\nThe Deuill to his Fellow, and delight\\r\\nNo lesse in truth then life. My first false speaking\\r\\nWas this vpon my selfe. What I am truly\\r\\nIs thine, and my poore Countries to command:\\r\\nWhither indeed, before they heere approach\\r\\nOld Seyward with ten thousand warlike men\\r\\nAlready at a point, was setting foorth:\\r\\nNow wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesse\\r\\nBe like our warranted Quarrell. Why are you silent?\\r\\n  Macd. Such welcome, and vnwelcom things at once\\r\\n'Tis hard to reconcile.\\r\\nEnter a Doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mal. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth\\r\\nI pray you?\\r\\n  Doct. I Sir: there are a crew of wretched Soules\\r\\nThat stay his Cure: their malady conuinces\\r\\nThe great assay of Art. But at his touch,\\r\\nSuch sanctity hath Heauen giuen his hand,\\r\\nThey presently amend.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mal. I thanke you Doctor\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. What's the Disease he meanes?\\r\\n  Mal. Tis call'd the Euill.\\r\\nA most myraculous worke in this good King,\\r\\nWhich often since my heere remaine in England,\\r\\nI haue seene him do: How he solicites heauen\\r\\nHimselfe best knowes: but strangely visited people\\r\\nAll swolne and Vlcerous, pittifull to the eye,\\r\\nThe meere dispaire of Surgery, he cures,\\r\\nHanging a golden stampe about their neckes,\\r\\nPut on with holy Prayers, and 'tis spoken\\r\\nTo the succeeding Royalty he leaues\\r\\nThe healing Benediction. With this strange vertue,\\r\\nHe hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,\\r\\nAnd sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,\\r\\nThat speake him full of Grace.\\r\\nEnter Rosse.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macd. See who comes heere\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. My Countryman: but yet I know him not\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. My euer gentle Cozen, welcome hither\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. I know him now. Good God betimes remoue\\r\\nThe meanes that makes vs Strangers\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Sir, Amen\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Stands Scotland where it did?\\r\\n  Rosse. Alas poore Countrey,\\r\\nAlmost affraid to know it selfe. It cannot\\r\\nBe call'd our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing\\r\\nBut who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:\\r\\nWhere sighes, and groanes, and shrieks that rent the ayre\\r\\nAre made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow seemes\\r\\nA Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,\\r\\nIs there scarse ask'd for who, and good mens liues\\r\\nExpire before the Flowers in their Caps,\\r\\nDying, or ere they sicken\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. What's the newest griefe?\\r\\n  Rosse. That of an houres age, doth hisse the speaker,\\r\\nEach minute teemes a new one\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. How do's my Wife?\\r\\n  Rosse. Why well\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. And all my Children?\\r\\n  Rosse. Well too\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. The Tyrant ha's not batter'd at their peace?\\r\\n  Rosse. No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue 'em\\r\\n  Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos't?\\r\\n  Rosse. When I came hither to transport the Tydings\\r\\nWhich I haue heauily borne, there ran a Rumour\\r\\nOf many worthy Fellowes, that were out,\\r\\nWhich was to my beleefe witnest the rather,\\r\\nFor that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.\\r\\nNow is the time of helpe: your eye in Scotland\\r\\nWould create Soldiours, make our women fight,\\r\\nTo doffe their dire distresses\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Bee't their comfort\\r\\nWe are comming thither: Gracious England hath\\r\\nLent vs good Seyward, and ten thousand men,\\r\\nAn older, and a better Souldier, none\\r\\nThat Christendome giues out\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Would I could answer\\r\\nThis comfort with the like. But I haue words\\r\\nThat would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,\\r\\nWhere hearing should not latch them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. What concerne they,\\r\\nThe generall cause, or is it a Fee-griefe\\r\\nDue to some single brest?\\r\\n  Rosse. No minde that's honest\\r\\nBut in it shares some woe, though the maine part\\r\\nPertaines to you alone\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. If it be mine\\r\\nKeepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer,\\r\\nWhich shall possesse them with the heauiest sound\\r\\nthat euer yet they heard\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Humh: I guesse at it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Your Castle is surpriz'd: your Wife, and Babes\\r\\nSauagely slaughter'd: To relate the manner\\r\\nWere on the Quarry of these murther'd Deere\\r\\nTo adde the death of you\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Mercifull Heauen:\\r\\nWhat man, ne're pull your hat vpon your browes:\\r\\nGiue sorrow words; the griefe that do's not speake,\\r\\nWhispers the o're-fraught heart, and bids it breake\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. My Children too?\\r\\n  Ro. Wife, Children, Seruants, all that could be found\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. And I must be from thence? My wife kil'd too?\\r\\n  Rosse. I haue said\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Be comforted.\\r\\nLet's make vs Med'cines of our great Reuenge,\\r\\nTo cure this deadly greefe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. He ha's no Children. All my pretty ones?\\r\\nDid you say All? Oh Hell-Kite! All?\\r\\nWhat, All my pretty Chickens, and their Damme\\r\\nAt one fell swoope?\\r\\n  Malc. Dispute it like a man\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I shall do so:\\r\\nBut I must also feele it as a man;\\r\\nI cannot but remember such things were\\r\\nThat were most precious to me: Did heauen looke on,\\r\\nAnd would not take their part? Sinfull Macduff,\\r\\nThey were all strooke for thee: Naught that I am,\\r\\nNot for their owne demerits, but for mine\\r\\nFell slaughter on their soules: Heauen rest them now\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Be this the Whetstone of your sword, let griefe\\r\\nConuert to anger: blunt not the heart, enrage it\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. O I could play the woman with mine eyes,\\r\\nAnd Braggart with my tongue. But gentle Heauens,\\r\\nCut short all intermission: Front to Front,\\r\\nBring thou this Fiend of Scotland, and my selfe\\r\\nWithin my Swords length set him, if he scape\\r\\nHeauen forgiue him too\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. This time goes manly:\\r\\nCome go we to the King, our Power is ready,\\r\\nOur lacke is nothing but our leaue. Macbeth\\r\\nIs ripe for shaking, and the Powres aboue\\r\\nPut on their Instruments: Receiue what cheere you may,\\r\\nThe Night is long, that neuer findes the Day.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nActus Quintus. Scena Prima.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter a Doctor of Physicke, and a Wayting Gentlewoman.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Doct. I haue too Nights watch'd with you, but can\\r\\nperceiue no truth in your report. When was it shee last\\r\\nwalk'd?\\r\\n  Gent. Since his Maiesty went into the Field, I haue\\r\\nseene her rise from her bed, throw her Night-Gown vppon\\r\\nher, vnlocke her Closset, take foorth paper, folde it,\\r\\nwrite vpon't, read it, afterwards Seale it, and againe returne\\r\\nto bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleepe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. A great perturbation in Nature, to receyue at\\r\\nonce the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching.\\r\\nIn this slumbry agitation, besides her walking, and other\\r\\nactuall performances, what (at any time) haue you heard\\r\\nher say?\\r\\n  Gent. That Sir, which I will not report after her\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. You may to me, and 'tis most meet you should\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent. Neither to you, nor any one, hauing no witnesse\\r\\nto confirme my speech.\\r\\nEnter Lady, with a Taper.\\r\\n\\r\\nLo you, heere she comes: This is her very guise, and vpon\\r\\nmy life fast asleepe: obserue her, stand close\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. How came she by that light?\\r\\n  Gent. Why it stood by her: she ha's light by her continually,\\r\\n'tis her command\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. You see her eyes are open\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent. I, but their sense are shut\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. What is it she do's now?\\r\\nLooke how she rubbes her hands\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent. It is an accustom'd action with her, to seeme\\r\\nthus washing her hands: I haue knowne her continue in\\r\\nthis a quarter of an houre\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lad. Yet heere's a spot\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Heark, she speaks, I will set downe what comes\\r\\nfrom her, to satisfie my remembrance the more strongly\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. Out damned spot: out I say. One: Two: Why\\r\\nthen 'tis time to doo't: Hell is murky. Fye, my Lord, fie,\\r\\na Souldier, and affear'd? what need we feare? who knowes\\r\\nit, when none can call our powre to accompt: yet who\\r\\nwould haue thought the olde man to haue had so much\\r\\nblood in him\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Do you marke that?\\r\\n  Lad. The Thane of Fife, had a wife: where is she now?\\r\\nWhat will these hands ne're be cleane? No more o'that\\r\\nmy Lord, no more o'that: you marre all with this starting\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Go too, go too:\\r\\nYou haue knowne what you should not\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent. She ha's spoke what shee should not, I am sure\\r\\nof that: Heauen knowes what she ha's knowne\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. Heere's the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes\\r\\nof Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.\\r\\nOh, oh, oh\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. What a sigh is there? The hart is sorely charg'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent. I would not haue such a heart in my bosome,\\r\\nfor the dignity of the whole body\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Well, well, well\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent. Pray God it be sir\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. This disease is beyond my practise: yet I haue\\r\\nknowne those which haue walkt in their sleep, who haue\\r\\ndyed holily in their beds\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lad. Wash your hands, put on your Night-Gowne,\\r\\nlooke not so pale: I tell you yet againe Banquo's buried;\\r\\nhe cannot come out on's graue\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Euen so?\\r\\n  Lady. To bed, to bed: there's knocking at the gate:\\r\\nCome, come, come, come, giue me your hand: What's\\r\\ndone, cannot be vndone. To bed, to bed, to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit Lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Doct. Will she go now to bed?\\r\\n  Gent. Directly\\r\\n\\r\\n   Doct. Foule whisp'rings are abroad: vnnaturall deeds\\r\\nDo breed vnnaturall troubles: infected mindes\\r\\nTo their deafe pillowes will discharge their Secrets:\\r\\nMore needs she the Diuine, then the Physitian:\\r\\nGod, God forgiue vs all. Looke after her,\\r\\nRemoue from her the meanes of all annoyance,\\r\\nAnd still keepe eyes vpon her: So goodnight,\\r\\nMy minde she ha's mated, and amaz'd my sight.\\r\\nI thinke, but dare not speake\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gent. Good night good Doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScena Secunda.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrum and Colours. Enter Menteth, Cathnes, Angus, Lenox,\\r\\nSoldiers.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Ment.
